Real-time dart detection and tracking using multiple cameras
Automatic score calculation based on dart positions
Support for the  501 game mode basic still need work 
User interface for score correction and game management
Calibration functionality for accurate dart tracking
Dart count, score fixed count, and accuracy percentage tracking
Saving and loading of counter data
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Tkinter
Shapely
Hardware Setup
The system requires the following hardware components:

3 cameras positioned around the dartboard (right, left, and top)
A computer or device to run the code and process the camera feeds
Ensure that the cameras are properly connected and indexed correctly in the code.

Calibtating , select four points on the outher double intersection of 20 and 1 , 6 and 10 , 19 and 3 ,11 and 14 . in that order on all 3 webcams
